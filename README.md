# EA-Game-Fifa20-Players-Ground-Positions
EA Sports is a division of Electronic Arts that develops and
publishes sports video games. Formerly a marketing gimmick
of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports
networks by calling themselves the "EA Sports Network"
(EASN)




Knowledge Discovery through Brand Stories FIFA is a series of association football video games developed and released annually by Electronic Arts under the EA Sports
label. As of 2011, the FIFA franchise has been localized into 18 languages and available in 51 countries. Listed in Guinness World Records as the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world, the FIFA series has sold over 325 million copies as of 2021. FIFA is best selling game franchise followed by SIMS and Need for Speed.


Starting from FIFA 20, EA Sports has given the option to gamers to create their own players. Pick any player – the race and gender you pick don’t matter here. In the
customization section of FIFA 20, you’re able to fully design your own player. You can choose what clothes your player wears, but the tabs at the top also allow you to customize
their name, sex, race, and appearance.

# Introduction

Knowledge Discovery through Brand Stories Apart from choosing skin, you can also change player attributes like stamina, dribbling, goalkeeping reflexes, ball control. These attributes will change player behavior on the soccer field. Also, the player's best position will also change. We will be using machine learning to predict the best position
for this newly created player. We will train a model on current players' attributes and their current playing positions.

# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a classification machine learning algorithm that can only classify data points into two classes, that is it's a binary classification algorithm. It consists of two parts, we apply linear regression followed by a logistic function. In linear regression, we try to fit a linear line with our training data points. After training, we will get output in range (-∞, ∞), but we wanted the output to be in the range [0,1], where 0 means class 1, and 1 means class 2. To change our output range we pass it through a special
function called logistic regression.

# One v/s Rest

As you read on the previous page, logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm but our problem is a multiclass classification problem, where we have to classify players into four categories attacker, midfielder, defender, and goalkeeper. So we should use a different classification algorithm. Instead of studying a complete new algorithm, we will use 4 logistic regression models. First model will check wether the player is an attacker or not, similarly other models will check other positions. This is known as One
v/s Rest, using we can use any binary classifier in multiclass classification problem.
